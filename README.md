# My First Challenge
I started webDev learning a feel months, and a friend challenged me:

"Try to make a Copy of a Landing Page." 

And here is the landing page image!

I used to create this copy, my lerning about HTML and CSS, the JS that I used it's a copy, I did not learn yet, but.

More is comming...

I learning JS now, and want to make this landing efficient responsiveness.
